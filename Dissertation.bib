abstract = {This study evaluated the transfer of training and training efficiency of two virtual reality environments (head-mounted display and personal computer) for a complex manual assembly task. Transfer of training was measured by comparing the post-training performance of two virtual training groups, a real-world training group and a control group that received no training. All training groups were taught to assemble a Lego forklift model in their respective environment. After training, participants assembled a real-world model of the forklift as well as a novel model of a racecar, which required the same parts as the forklift assembled in a different configuration. Results from this study show that virtual environments can be effective training simulators for complex assembly tasks although they are less efficient than real-world training. The results also suggest that individual differences such as general intelligence, spatial aptitude, and computer user self-efficacy influence one's ability to learn in a virtual environment.

abstract = {22: Main argument: People behave in the world as they see it. Whatever the flaws, cognitive maps determine our spatial behavior. 9: Definition: "Cognitive mapping is a process composed of a series of psychological transformations by which an indvidual acquires, codes, stores, recalls, and decodes infromation about the relative locations an dattributes of phenomena in his everyday spatial enviornment." 9: "...human spatial behavior is dependent on the individual's cognitive map of the spatial environment." 10: Definitions: Cognitive mapping is the "process of acquisition, amalgamation, and storage" of spatial environment data. The cognitive map is the end "product of this process." 10: The cognitive map is a prerequisite for human survival and everyday functionality. Cognitive mapping is a necessary component of human behavior. Cognitive mapping allows "the indvidual to answer two basic questions quickly and efficiently: (1) Where certain vlued things are; (2) How to get to where they are from where he is." 11: Cartographic maps strongly influence how scientists, and everyday humans, have conceptualized and visualized what a cognitive map must look like and how it must function. 11: Top-down information from other types of maps share the same "function" but not the same "structure" - thus "cognitive maps are derived from analogies of process, not product." That is, similar processes exist between cartographic and cognitive mapping, but not the same end result. 11: Definition: Signature is a series of processes that give rise to how our environment is encoded and decoded. A cartographic map signature is dependent upon three processes: roation of point of view to a vertical perspective, change in scale, and abstraction to set of symbols. The same process takes hold for a cognitive map, with minor variations (p12). 12: Argument: Process and product cloud our judgment concerning cognitive maps/mapping. When we use the terms, it becomes ambiguous whether we are referring to process or product in our analysis. Crucial difference between the two! 14: Definition: Perception: object is noticed by one of the senses and induces a reaction or recognition of some kind. Environmental cognition differs, because it need not be something in the immediate environment and it may be something from the past. 14: Definition: "Cognition" is a more general, broad term, incorporating "perception, as well as thinking, problem solving, and the organization of information and ideas." 14: Geographers are concerned with the development and individual creation of environmental cognitions, not merely episodic spatial perceptions. 14: Definition: "Attitudes" are the things that lead people to behave or perceive in certain ways. I would argue that Lakoff's "understanding" makes more sense now. 16: Boulding 1956: There are no facts for individuals, only messages filtered through a changing value system. Again, very similar to Lakoff's "understanding." 16: To understand what cognitive maps are, we must answer three questions: 1) what do people need to know? 2) What do people know? and 3) How do people get their knowledge? 16: 1) People must know two types of information to survive: a) location and b) attributes. From this, knowledge of distance is also crucial and determinable. 17: 2) All cognitive maps are discontinuous. There are gaps in what we know and remember. Maps are distorted, schematized, and algamated. 18: Places can "denote" something but have no "connotative" or personal meaning, therefore having no impact on the person's behavior. Therefore, "we must be careful in interpreting the absence of phenomena from cognitive maps as reflecting cognitive discontinuity of space." 22: People get their knowledge through their senses and first and second-hand experiences.},

abstract = {Pedestrian movement studies in real environments have shown consistent statistical relationships between configurational properties of spatial layouts and movement flows, facilitating prediction of movement from designs. However, these studies are at an aggregate level and say nothing about how individuals make the micro-scale decisions producing these emergent regularities.They do not therefore explain movement. Progress on this is difficult since decision-making mechanisms are hard to observe in the real world and the experimenter effect is ever-present. Could the study of movement in immersive virtual environments help? If it could be shown that movement in virtual environments was analogous to movement in real environments then micro- behaviour data (head movement, direction of gaze, visual search behaviours) could be obtained through virtual experiments. The aim of this thesis is to explore this possibility by constructing experimental worlds with spatial properties varied to reflect those known to relate to movement in the real world, and asking individuals navigate through them immersively. Powerful analogies are initially demonstrated between virtual and real behaviour. Two types of micro-scale analysis are then performed: linear analysis, examining how routes are formed and how far linearity is conserved, using measurements of cumulative angular deviation along a path, string-matching algorithms to determine average routes, and analysis of isovist attributes along routes; and positional analysis, focussing upon pausing behaviour, including examining where subjects pause along routes, what choices are made at junctions, how isovist properties of pause-locations compare with an environments overall isovist attribute distribution, and correlating pause-point and isovist data. In each analysis, subjective movement behaviour is related to objective properties of environments. The experiments show results strongly suggesting how noted aggregate regularities are produced: linearity is strongly conserved, usually following long sight-lines, with pauses in configurationally integrated locations offering strategic visual properties, long lines of sight, and large isovist areas.},

abstract = {We investigated whether and how student performance on three types of spatial cognition tasks differs when worked with two-dimensional or stereoscopic representations. We recruited nineteen middle school students visiting a planetarium in a large Midwestern American city and analyzed their performance on a series of spatial cognition tasks in terms of response accuracy and task completion time. Results show that response accuracy did not differ between the two types of representations while task completion time was significantly greater with the stereoscopic representations. The completion time increased as the number of mental manipulations of 3D objects increased in the tasks. Post-interviews provide evidence that some students continued to think of stereoscopic representations as two-dimensional. Based on cognitive load and cue theories, we interpret that, in the absence of pictorial depth cues, students may need more time to be familiar with stereoscopic representations for optimal performance. In light of these results, we discuss potential uses of stereoscopic representations for science learning.

abstract = {The use of virtual reality as tool in the area of spatial cognition raises the question of the quality of learning transfer from a virtual to a real environment. It is first necessary to determine with healthy subjects, the cognitive aids that improve the quality of transfer and the conditions required, especially since virtual reality can be used as effective tool in cognitive rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of the exploration mode of virtual environment (Passive vs. Active) according to Route complexity (Simple vs. Complex) on the quality of spatial knowledge transfer in three spatial tasks. Ninety subjects (45 men and 45 women) participated. Spatial learning was evaluated by Wayfinding, sketch-mapping and picture classification tasks in the context of the Bordeaux district. In the Wayfinding task, results indicated that active learning in a Virtual Environment (VE) increased the performances compared to the passive learning condition, irrespective of the route complexity factor. In the Sketch-mapping task, active learning in a VE helped the subjects to transfer their spatial knowledge from the VE to reality, but only when the route was complex. In the Picture classification task, active learning in a VE when the route was complex did not help the subjects to transfer their spatial knowledge. These results are explained in terms of knowledge levels and frame/strategy of reference.},

Using the concept of fidelity, we examine the variables that mediate the transfer of spatial knowledge and discuss the form and development of spatial representations in VE training. We report the results of an experiment in which groups were trained in six different environments (no training, real world, map, VE desktop, VE immersive, and VE long immersive) and then were asked to apply route and configurational knowledge in a real-world maze environment. Short periods of VE training were no more effective than map training; however with sufficient exposure to the virtual training environment, VE training eventually surpassed real-world training. Robust gender differences in training effectiveness of VEs were also found.},

abstract = {(from the chapter) Describes 3 approaches to training decision making in the Combat Information Center context as part of the US Navy's Tactical Decision Making Under Stress research project. The part-task approach, based on automaticity theory, provides a method for ensuring that costly and complex tactical decision-making and team-coordination training will have its maximum benefit by ensuring that personnel come to this training fully skilled in console manipulation activities. Empirical results indicate that the design of part-task training systems could result in substantial cost savings. The real-time, embedded feedback augmentation approach provides a method for improving the standardization, timeliness, and diagnosticity of feedback by augmenting the feedback provided by expert coaches with automated feedback embedded within the task context itself. Empirical results indicate that feedback augmentation can significantly improve training effectiveness in complex, dynamic environments. Finally, the diagnostic approach to feedback augmentation, although still in its concept-exploration stage, holds promise for targeting feedback to a particular trainee's misconceptions or oversimplifications of the task environment, as evidenced in his or her history of decision-making behavior.

abstract = {Game-based training offers great potential for providing low-cost training systems for learning cognitive and procedural skills within the U.S. Navy. We introduce an effort, sponsored by the Office of Naval Research, to harness, apply and harden this capability by creating validated training games for the Navy. Over the period of fourteen months, our multi-disciplinary team collaborated to develop and validate a flooding control training game to help students at the U.S. Navy Recruit Training Command (RTC) learn to be better sailors. The Flooding Control Trainer (FCT) provides individual training within the simulated interior of an Arleigh-Burke class destroyer. The trainer reinforces damage control skills that the recruits have been exposed to in lectures, but which they have not had a chance to practice in context. In developing the trainer, we focused on both the specific application domain as well as the design methods required to ensure that the trainer was based on relevant learning objectives, incorporated a strong narrative, used an instructional strategy and a game play style that were complementary, and contained embedded assessment capabilities. The FCT is based on the open-source Delta3D engine. To support effective training, we augmented the engine with a task-based instructional infrastructure and a variety of feedback mechanisms, including real-time guidance and feedback as well as after-action debrief. We conducted several empirical tests of the product, including a usability study and a learning validation study using the target recruit population as subjects. The results indicate that the FCT is usable, well-received by recruits and produces a significant improvement in performance across a range of cognitive and procedural skills, including situational awareness, communications, navigation and decision-making. We present our approach, describe the training game design, discuss the studies conducted and their results, and discuss next steps to create Navy training games for use beyond RTC.

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) has excited the instructional technology community for a variety of reasons, including the notion that instructional systems using VR interfaces are potentially more motivating than traditional two-dimensional interfaces. If learning can be made more interesting and fun, students may remain engaged for longer periods of time. In addition, there may be unique benefits to having students experientially engaged in the learning context. The VK interface allows learning to be situated in a virtual simula- tion of the tasks or information to be learned, possibly attenuating problems associated with inert knowledge (Whitehead, 1929). Inert knowledge is knowledge that learners fail to apply outside the classroom, even though it is relevant. Another reason for excitement is that the highly visual character of even current-generation virtual reality may be able to capitalize on the disproportionately visual capabilities of the human brain. Finally, VR sys- tems may one day prove to be extremely cost-effective interfaces for simula- tion-based training, since one VR system can simulate many target systems. But before we can realize the potential of virtual reality for instruction, a significant amount of research must be done.},

abstract = {Virtual environments (VEs) are extensively used in training but there have been few rigorous scientific investigations of whether and how skills learned in a VE are transferred to the real world. This research aimed to measure and evaluate what is transferring from training a simple sensorimotor task in a VE to real world performance. In experiment 1, real world performances after virtual training, real training and no training were compared. Virtual and real training resulted in equivalent levels of post-training performance, both of which significantly exceeded task performance without training. Experiments 2 and 3 investigated whether virtual and real trained real world performances differed in their susceptibility to cognitive and motor interfering tasks (experiment 2) and in terms of spare attentional capacity to respond to stimuli and instructions which were not directly related to the task (experiment 3). The only significant difference found was that real task performance after training in a VE was less affected by concurrently performed interference tasks than was real task performance after training on the real task. This finding is discussed in terms of the cognitive load characteristics of virtual training. Virtual training therefore resulted in equivalent or even better real world performance than real training in this simple sensorimotor task, but this finding may not apply to other training tasks. Future research should be directed towards establishing a comprehensive knowledge of what is being transferred to real world performance in other tasks currently being trained in VEs and investigating the equivalence of virtual and real trained performances in these situations.},

SubSafe is a recent example of what can be achieved in part-task naval training applications using gaming technologies, exploiting freely available, freely distributable software. SubSafe is a proof-of-concept demonstrator that presents end users with an interactive, real-time three-dimensional model of part of a Trafalgar Class submarine. This “Part 1” paper presents the background to the SubSafe project and outlines the experimental design for a pilot study being conducted between August 2008 and January 2009, in conjunction with the Royal Navy's Submarine School in Devonport. The study is investigating knowledge transfer from the classroom to a real submarine environment (during week 7 of the students' “Submarine Qualification Dry” course), together with general usability and interactivity assessments. Part 2 of the paper (to be completed in early 2009) will present the results of these trials and consider future extensions of the research into other submarine training domains, including periscope ranging and look-interval assessment skills, survival systems deployment training and the planning and rehearsal of submersible rescue operations.},

abstract = {One aim of virtual reality technology is to immerse the user in a digital environment that is distinct from physical reality. Feeling spatially located in this digital environment is central to the experience and is more formally known as spatial presence. Experiences of spatial presence differ between individuals; prominent theories assume that these differences may, in part, be explained by differences in more general spatial abilities. Whilst there is some support for this claim with desktop systems, there is currently no direct empirical evidence to support this with more immersive technologies such as head-mounted displays (HMDs). In this study, participants completed three different measures of spatial ability before experiencing two virtual environments. These measures included a self-report of visuospatial imagery; the mental rotations test; and a test of topographical memory. After completing the measures, participants briefly experienced a virtual city and a virtual train ride through a HMD. The user's head movements were tracked, and visual displays were updated to give the sense of a full 360° environment. After each experience, the participants reported how present they felt and the extent to which they had a mental model of the environment. Self-reports of imagery were positively correlated with reports of spatial presence, consistent with the previous literature. However, spatial presence was not related to performance on either of the more objective tests. Whilst this provides confirmatory evidence that self-reports of imagery can predict presence, it is still unclear which more basic spatial abilities, if any, could underlie this relationship.},

abstract = {(from the preface) This book presents a framework for examining and establishing effective training programs in education, business, and government. This edition adds new information covering the use of computer technology and the Web to conduct training, as well as coverage of contemporary training issues, such as changes in demographics, the influences of technology, and the increasing emphasis on international concerns. The authors believe that needs assessment, design and development of a learning environment, and thoughtful evaluation of instruction efforts form critical foundations for working with training systems in organizational settings. They work toward considering these perspectives on needs assessment, learning environments, and evaluation within the context of the dynamic changes facing organizations today. The authors also introduce many of the new training systems, such as virtual reality training and web-based instruction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},
